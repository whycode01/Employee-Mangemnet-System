# Employee-Mangemnet-System
Using the concepts of OOP , created a program to take details of employees of a company and show it . 
It takes the inputs from the user reagadring the details of employees . 
Used the concept of getter & setter to abstract the data from the class as it is under private section .
Will be improvising the program using data file handling to store the inputs so that it can be used in future .
